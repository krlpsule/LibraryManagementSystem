PROJECT DETAILS

This project is made to manage a library, making possible storage of books and users data, adding and deleting books, as well renting them and managing the waiting list. 
 
MAIN

In the main file, we mostly work with user interface, using switch to choose the menu actions and activate methods in other classes.

For user comfort we implemented a  method to only accept the numbers for the ID values, since entering other characters throws exceptions.

Also method to show a message to show menu again, since otherwise it is hard to locate the results.

In every button section there are messages for user, to understand what have been done and if there are mistakes, such as using non-numeric values for the ID.
